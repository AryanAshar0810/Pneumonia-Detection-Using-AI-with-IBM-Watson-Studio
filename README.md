# Pneumonia Detection Using X-RAYs and using IBM Watson Studio

In this project we aim to create a model that will be able to detect whether the person is suffering from pneumonia or not. The main objective of this project is to help the doctors to predict the pneumonia disease more accurately using a deep learning model. The objective is not only to help the doctors but also to the patients to precisely predict pneumonia.
